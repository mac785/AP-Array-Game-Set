/**
 * The Referee class keeps track of a Board, which in turn

 * regularly, the user is asked for "SET"s of cards, and the board is
 * consulted on whether the user is correct before removing them.
 * If the board is empty, or the player gives up, the player can play again.
 * Advanced: if the player is stumped with 12 cards, give him/her the
 * chance to add three more cards.
