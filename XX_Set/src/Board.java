	 * A SET is formed when for each of the four categories, all the cards

	 * 0: {**} {**} {**}
	 * 1: [**] [**]
	 * 2: <**>
	 * this is a "SET" because: a) the brackets are different on all three 
	 * cards; b) the number of groups is different on all three cards; 
	 * c) the size of the groups are the same on all three cards; and d)
	 * the icon is the same on all three cards.
	 * Here's another example of a "SET":
	 * 0: {•} {•}
	 * 1: {ooo} {ooo}
	 * 2: {**} {**}
	 * In this case the brackets and number of groups are constant, but
	 * the icon and the size of the groups are all different.
	 * Here's an example of a non-"SET."
	 * 0: {o} {o}
	 * 1: <•> <•> <•>
	 * 2: [o]
	 * In this case, the group sizes are all the same, the number of groups
	 * are all different, the brackets are all different, BUT two of the
	 * cards have the icon "o" and one has the icon "•." So this is NOT a "SET."
	 * Another example of a non-"SET.":
	 * 0: {**} {**} {**}
	 * 1: {•}
	 * 2: <ooo> <ooo>
	 * In this case, it is the bracket types that fail; there are two cards with
	 * curly brackets and one with angle brackets.
	 * Note: If you are given the same card twice (or three times), it is illegal.
	 * Note: If any of the cards are null, it is illegal.
